# Instagram Posts Downloader

This program was created with the intention of a user being able to download posts from whatever instagram page they specify and view them on their local machine. This can be useful in ML classification projects, NLP projects or simply to view posts from your favorite page without getting caught in the 'death scroll' of social media. 

User can specify a range of dates from which they would like to download posts. Supports both photos and videos.

GUI forthcoming.
